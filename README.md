#Score Board Challenge

For this challenge I parsed a JSON file in order to display some of the data through
a scoreboard. I decided to use React, and I parsed the information that I needed from
the JSON into a single object called the store. The store was then passed down
in the props to the various React components.  

#Set Up

First clone the repository to your local computer. Then in your terminal run:
  npm install -g create-react-app
This command will install the React package that I used. Then once inside the
repository in your terminal run:
  npm install

Finally run:

  npm start

This should open up the challenge in your browser.
